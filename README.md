# BluetoothBarcodeScanner
A small application to discover SPP bluetooth scanning devices and receive barcodes.

This demonstration will show a list of paired devices, and attempt to connect to the selected device. If it is an SPP device that can send data, the demonstration will treat it as a scanner that reads and sends barcodes.

The user can search for the barcode scanned on the web.
